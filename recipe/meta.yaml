  patches:
    # Upstream has tagged version 1.0.7 on main but did not release it on PyPi / GitHub
    # See https://github.com/trevorprater/pymorton/issues/4
    # This patch was created by https://github.com/trevorprater/pymorton/compare/1.0.5...master.diff
    - v1.0.7.patch
    # pymorton was mainly tested on Python2, where it correctly detects 32/64 bit machines.
    # On Python3 however, it always default to 32bit. See https://github.com/trevorprater/pymorton/issues/5
    # Upstream PR: https://github.com/trevorprater/pymorton/pull/6
    - fix-64-bit.patch

  summary: 'Ordinal hashing of multidimensional data and geographic coordinates via Morton coding / Z-ordering.'
  description: |
    In mathematical analysis and computer science, Z-order, Morton-order, or a Morton-code
    is a function which maps multidimensional data to one dimension while preserving locality
    of the data points. It was introduced in 1966 by IBM researcher, G. M. Morton. The z-value
    of a point in multidimensions is calculated by interleaving the binary representations of
    its coordinate values. Once the data are sorted into this ordering, any one-dimensional data 
    structure can be used, such as binary search trees, B-trees, skip lists, or hash tables.
    The resulting ordering can equivalently be described as the order one would achieve from a
    depth-first traversal of a quadtree, where {x, y, â€¦, K} are combined into a single ordinal
    value that is easily compared, searched, and indexed against other Morton numbers.
